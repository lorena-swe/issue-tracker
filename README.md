Issue Tracker is a web application designed to help teams manage and track issues efficiently. The app features a comprehensive dashboard for viewing the latest issues, a bar chart categorizing issues by their status (Open, In Progress, Closed), and an issue list page where all issues can be viewed and managed.

**Features**

- **Dashboard**: View the latest issues and a bar chart showing the distribution of issues by status.
- **Issue List**: Filter issues by status and sort by title, status, or created date. View issues in a table format for easy management.
- **Authentication**: Secure login through Google authentication using NextAuth.
- **Issue Management**: Create, edit, and delete issues. Each issue includes a title and a description, with the description supporting React Markdown for rich text formatting.
- **User Experience**: Loading skeletons provide a smooth user experience while data is being fetched.
